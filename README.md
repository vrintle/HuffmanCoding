Requirements:

1. Keep the source text in a `source.txt` file in the same directory.
2. You can find the compressed binary text file as `encoded.txt` in the same directory only.
3. Some unnecessary logs will be present in `logs.txt` file, which you can ignore safely.

How to run:

First, open up your terminal in the current directory, then execute `g++ main.cpp` (if you have G++ compiler installed), then run the `a.out` application which is created in your directory. That's it.
